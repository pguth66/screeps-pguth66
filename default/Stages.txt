Bootstrapping

First stage is just to get to RCL 1
    UPDATE: now controller is blocked for 800 ticks right after you claim it
        so spend that time building containers by the sources
    Basic creeps (WORK CARRY MOVE)
    No roads needed (creeps don't carry much so won't be that slow)
    No containers
    3 workers (upgrading, no healing)
    All these creeps need to come from another room!
    so have that room defined as RoomToClaim 
    if Game.rooms[roomname] doesn't exist, or exists but isn't owned by me, send a single claimer
    if it does exist and isn't owned by me, wait for the claimer to get there
    if it does exist and is owned by me, send 3 worker creeps
After RCL1, focus on building a spawn
    Workers switch to building until we have the spawn
    Put spawn near source so you can use it to heal harvesters after they get boosted
    Once we have a spawn, focus is on getting to RCL2
    For now keep this with basic creeps, no roads
    Workers focus on upgrading, harvesters to keep spawn full
    Workers pulling from sources?
    (if distance is really long, use 2 containers with haulers?)
RCL2 - extensions
    Place extensions - diamond around spawn?
    Workers build extensions until they're all ready - now we have 550 energy capacity
    WHere do workers get energy? source? spawn? harvesters are still harvesting....
    After extensions are built we specialize - haulers, harvesters, workers
    So build containers next to source(s) - so need some code to know how many we have
RCL3 - containers?
    now speicalized dudes, lay down new extensions, build container
    dudes will pull from container, so want to speed up harvesting, build 3-4 with 2 WORKs
