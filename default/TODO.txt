Handle different stages
    startup - goal is to get to stage 2, so mostly upgraders with a harvester so you can keep spawning upgraders
        actually don't need harvesters because upgraders pull from spawn in the beginning
        first step is to get to RC1 - which is just upgraders pulling from spawn
        then at RC1 drop a spawn and go mostly builders, with just one upgrader to keep things going
        once you have a spawn can go for upgraders again and build roads, then extensions
        no containers
        300 energy
        spawn 300 energy creeps
            harvesters bring back to spawn and extensions
            builders pull from spawn and build containers
            single upgrader to keep things moving
            this might be too expensive, containers cost 5000 and RC2 only takes a few hundred
        ends at rc2? - then you build 5 extensions (containers were too expensive to build here)
    stage 2
        build roads - roads cost 300
            containers to upgrader first? (most used)
            or containers to spawn?
        build extensions - extensions cost 3000
            try to build 2 squares away from spawn - left right up down
            then in the corners (2+2)
        ends when you have 5 extensions and roads to each spawn
        need a lot of builders in this stage (like 5) and probably 2 harvesters, and no roads since you're still at 300 cost creeps
    stage 3
        build containers (four containers at RC1, try to put them at closest spawn)
        switch harvesters to no CARRY
        switch builders to pull from containers (maybe they already could have been)

mineral hauler 
    goes and picks up all non-energy stuff from containers etc 
        and brings them to some central dropoff DONE
    have regular hauler flip to one of these if there are minerals outside storage/terminal
    then flip back to regular hauler after dropoff
    still need to handle the auto-spawning

OMG you lose boosts when you renew a creep!!!!
make haulers treat Links as sources so they wil take stuff from link to storage etc - DONE
make warriors only attack spawns and towers, so they don't destroy structures with energy in them - DONE
build roomMaps automatically
remove SOURCE/SINK code
switch to forEach for iterating over spawns in room
automatically sell minerals when I have too many
have creeps send message when blocked for > 5 ticks, and have other creep flee from them
    done via having blocking creep move randomly - but didn't implement the 5 tick limit
switch to a build queue in each room
have builders move away from source if they are full and near one - DONE
    say the source is at 23,24
    and the creep is at 24,24
    creep should move to 25,24
    so want to go 1 more in the direction the creep already is - 24 - 23 = 1 so go to 24 + 1 =5
    if reversed, creep at 23,24 source at 24,24
        then 23 - 24 = -1 23 + -1 = 22 - work
    so logic is creep.x + (creep.x - flee.x), same for y
    newX = creep.pos.x + (creep.pos.x - fleeTarget.pos.x)
    newY = creep.pos.y + (creep.pos.y - fleeTarget.pos.y)
    creep.moveTo(newX, newY)
make haulers deposit minerals in terminals instead of storage
do the lab logic 
    fill with energy
    select 2 as reactors and one as destination
    put the right mineral in the right place
    run the reaction 
    move the result to storage? or use it to boost creeps?
fix mineral logic to move to terminal in own room first - DONE ?
    only need minhaulers to gather from rooms without terminals
    temporarily fixed by having minhauler only move through room with no terminals
add logic to send energy from rooms with excess to rooms with deficit
    first via creep
        maybe use interhaulers? like with workROom = excessRoom and baseRoom= room to help
        so interhauler logic needs to support this, not sure if it does now (it does now!)
        not much point in this IMO
    then via terminal
make upgraders pull from links - DONE
add counter to creeps to count how long it takes to the first time they start working
add 'patrol' creep that will just sit in an unowned room - so has to handle the invaders of that size - DONE
add 'renew' flag to creeps that makes them respawn themselves - DONE
    make it happen at TTL = how long it took to get there
switch parts to have MOVE last so when someone gets attacked they can move out of the way if they're not dead - DONE
check for only having working MOVE parts, if so, recycle yourself - DONE
add logic to spawn another worker (builder) if SINK containers and links are full
if zero harvesters and can't spawn harvester you want, spawn one that costs <300
    fixed by making it go to 'start' stage if energy in room is under 700, that should allow spawning a harvester
make harvesters divide between sources and stick there DONE
    BUT doesn't handle sources with only one access point well
    should have it assign as is, but then try to path there and if no path available, try second one and if that works, assign that as target
    OR can count how many spots there are for harvesters
    OR just spawn one with 6 WORK parts (solution i picked) - costs 700 with 6 work, 1 carry, and 1 move, so can build it from RCL 3 on easily
Make haulers prioritize towers
Make haulers drop target if it's full of energy DONE
Have haulers pull out of storage if no other sources available
    Interactively I did this by flpping the Storage to SOURCE instead of SINK
Add flee bheaviors when creeps are attacked
Have non-harvesters move away from sources if they're on them
Make generic worker creeps that do builder,upgrader,healer
should harvetser and miner be the same creep?
should haulers and minhaulers be the same creep?
    minhaulers are different in that they need to go to terminal which may be in another room
    so that's like interhauler
Make a recycle role that just moves to spawn, then spawn recycles it - DONE
    really disappointing - it drops like 10 energy (based on TTL of creep)
    but still some value as now you can have it recycle when it's done working so doesn't disappear mid-work
Add renew or recycle of creeps - start with haulers as they move near spawn regularly - DONE
    like spawn searches for nearby creeps and if they need it, renews them
Add links - DONE
    haulers deposit in links DONE
    links tagged as source or sink (DONE - note they are backwards from containers)
    have haulers deposit in non-empty links FIRST if they are nearby (before spawns etc) DONE
        so when flip to hauling, check range to nearest SINK link, if < 3 make it target
        wonder if this could eventually lead to starvation?
    builders and upgraders pull from links DONE
    automatically send between links DONE
    make haulers pull from links to fill spawn/extensions (SOURCE links) DONE (when room under half energy)
use links to transfer energy to spawn/extensions
    have one creep that just keesp SOURCE links full
    other haulers pull from SINK link
make so terminal is kept at reasonable level before putting energy in storage
interroom harvesting 
    builders that go to another room and build roads and containers (pulling from source)
        container first, then switch to using harvesters while builders build roads
    harvesters that go to another room and harvesting
    haulers that go into another room, pick up from containers, and bring back to container in other room
attackers
    melee creep and healer creep
    teaming code so they wait for each other
    have a leader that records previous .pos and then have other guy move to that .pos (follow method)
Have claimers sign rooms (based on array of EQ dungeon names preferably)
fix report code to include all towers - DONE
Clean up old bestPath code - DONE
Better error handling (add dfeault at least for errors)
Make healers only heal walls up to some reasonable number (10k?) - DONE
Make healers pick walls to heal intelligently
Make haulers pick up dropped energy if there is any (via FIND_DROPPED_ENERGY) - DONE
    also used FIND_DROPPED_ENERGY at first and it told me to use FIND_DROPPED_RESOURCES - not sure if then 
        I need to specially handle whether it's ernergy or resources that I found.... - FIXED
Optimize creep design based off energy available
Reduce code duplication in spawner code
Reduce code duplication in creep runner code DONE
Make tower heal walls only a little bit (100k) - DONE
if no spawns in range for a harvester, make them deposit before doing anything else - DONE
add locking on to target for hauler SOURCES as well as SINKs
Build claimer creep - DONE
    CLAIM,CLAIM,MOVE
    go to another room 
        how to know which room? hardcode in Memory for now
    once there, reservecontroller || move to controller
    spawn another one when it dies (not doing this, manual for now to avoid losing them over and over)
Seems like building and upgrading are opopsites - when I want to build I want to stop upgrading - DONE
    so if we make upgraders be something that builders run after they don't have anything to build that could work
    keep one upgrader just so we always have upgrades 
Stop claimers from spawning if they're getting killed (otherwise wastes all resources)
    set a flag not to build
    send a notification
    flag has to be manually cleared from console (?)
Build attacker creeps when room is under attack DONE
    do a find for hostile creeps - if true set room.memory.foundHostiles = true DONE
    if foundHostiles, spawn warrior DONE 
    if no hostiles found, set room.memory.foundHostiles = false DONE
Make attack creeps stay on ramparts - not sure there's any value here
Activate safe mode when attacked (when it hits controller? or spawn?) DONE
    did this when towers are at half health
    should probably add same for spawns
Build ranged attacker creeps, have them stay within walls/ramparts
Make code run per room - DONE
Make haulers deposit in STORAGE - DONE
have creeps SAY errors (and not much else)
Optimize storage and container hauling
    right now haulers deposit in storage, then pull right out
        temporarily fixed by not using anything as a source unless it's half full
        fully fixed by designating SOURCEs and SINKs
    so want to sort by which ones are more full?
    really only want to put in storage when containers are full, but don't want to take from storage to 
        put in containers unless they are close to empty
    should sort container list to find the one that's got the least energy and deposit there
    proritize SOURCE containers that are close to full to prevent harvesters from having to drag stuff
    prioritize containers over storage?
    mark some containers as sources and some as sinks? DONE
    haulers should empty containers to fill spawns/extensions - so when room is below say 50% capacity, remove the energy requirement on pulling from containers
    if you have non-energy resources, pick a CONTAINER target
Make creeps run inside walls when attacked
Handle multiple terminals

add creeps (interharveter and interhaulr) to harvest from nextdoor room that I don't owner
    probably into a container next to the source
fix tower code to cycle through all of them - DONE
make claimers try to claim first, then reserve if that doesn't work
make non-harvesters move away from source if they aren't harvesting
fix claim logic so it will send builders and an upgrader to the room until the spawn is built
make harvesters split themselves between sources if more than one
    if sources = 1 then just go to that one
    if sources = 2 then alternate between the two (start with closest to spawn)
base harvester numbers etc on how quickly you can empty the source before restore (have to do the math)


NOTES
    find tower with
        Game.rooms['W46N97'].find(FIND_MY_STRUCTURES, {filter: {structureType: STRUCTURE_TOWER}})
    to get all rooms you can see
        for(i in Game.rooms) { console.log(Game.rooms[i].name) }
    find owner of room
