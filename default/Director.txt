basic idea is to give creeps orders, not have them figure evertything out each tick
start with travel orders
give creep a destination - already have _move.dest
basic logic is (assume harvester)
    director figures out which source this harvester should be at
    says "Creep, go harvest source at pos XY"
    Creep sets memory.underOrders to true
    Creep sets memory.assignedSource to 
    Creep then moves to XY
    When next to it, starts to harvest
    After harvesting, goes to deposit 
    After depositing, sets memory.needsOrders to true

how does director know where to send the harvester?
store a map of the room 
    actually an array? or object? containing objects for all sources, e.g.
    roomSources = [ source1object source2object]
