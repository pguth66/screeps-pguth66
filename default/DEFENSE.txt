OK, just got worked

came into my secondary room with a creep that had tons of healing
my tower attacked him but he healed himsefl up
when he broke through the wall and got close to my spawn, I activated safe mode. 
he died shortly after, not sure if because of safe mode or because of range to tower
then he attacked my main room - you can't have more than one room in safe mode at a time
main room exhausted tower energy and extension energy
I turned everyone into a hauler but it was too late and/or not enough
I changed tower to only attack people within 5 range
tower was mostly out of energy when he got there, it was hitting him at 5 range but he appeare3d to be able to heal through the damage
his creep has 10 HEAL, 12 RANGED_ATTACK, 7 MOVE, 6 TOUGH (says 35 parts)
    10 HEAL allows to heal 120 pts/damage per tick
    towers do 600 at less than 5
    creeps do 30 per ATTACK or 10 per RANGED_ATTACK
    so 20 ATTACK is the same as a tower (cost 1600)
    would need a creep with 5 ATTACK just to damage him past healing (and this is pre-boosts)
    or 60 RANGED is the same as a tower (9000 cost)
done different
    don't waste energy attacking him at range
    spawn a bruiser creep with tons of attack when he was close (sacrifice the walls)
    would have to distinguish between a bruiser attack vs just a scout
    walls were useless as he could just sit there and heal himself while busting through them
    need to be able to apply MAJOR damage over short period of time
    wonder if ranged attackers would be protected behind walls?
    have walls closer to towers
