Basic idea
    Take prototype (smallest version) of each kind of creep
        harvester
        hauler
        worker
        soldier
    Decide what the best makeup is based on
        energy available
        work to do (ex: no sense in harvesters that can drain a source too fast)
    so parameters are: creep type, energy available, energy capacity, RCL (or stage)
    for harvesters
        2 energy/tick/WORK
        sources are 3k energy, regenerate in 300 ticks
        so with 100% efficiency, need to harvest 10 energy per tick, or 5 WORK parameters
        so 2 with 3 parts (400 cost) or 1 with 6 (700) should do it
        PRESUMPTION: 2 per source with 3 WORKs should work in most rooms once we have containers to drop in
        Prior to that, 2 per source with basic makeup
    for haulers
    for workers
        generally mix of WORK, CARRY, MOVE - which is 200 for a grouping
        so generally they go 200, 400, 600 (although maybe 550 not sure you ever need 3 MOVEs)
