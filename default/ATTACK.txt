general strategy may be to send a creep that waits on the periphery and can heal itself,
    purpose being to drain energy
    so this would be something that can heal 150/tick (one tower) or (300/tick for two towers)
    150/tick is 13 HEAL parts, which costs 3250
    max my room has is 5000, at 250 per HEAL that would be 20 HEALs with nothing else
    so if 13 HEALs, 10 MOVEs, 27 TOUGHs = 3250 + 500 + 270 = 4020
    that creep needs to be able to move to a room to attack, then wait on the edge, and heal itself every tick

    role = bait

    move to room to attack
    move as far away from tower as possible while staying in room
        for now set a flag to move to?
    sit and heal yourself
    if you get below say 400 total health, move back to other room and heal up more
    if no room to attack move to SPAWN so you get healed (maybe make spawns heal these creeps at all HP)

once towers are down, send in a WARRIOR

need to fix code to deal with walls
    if no path to a target but hostile targets in room, then get PathByRange(?), walk that till you get to
    a wall, then break it down
    in the short term let me set a flag and then go attack that wall if no creeps/buildings reachable
