general strategy may be to send a creep that waits on the periphery and can heal itself,
    purpose being to drain energy
    so this would be something that can heal 150/tick (one tower) or (300/tick for two towers)
    150/tick is 13 HEAL parts, which costs 3250
    max my room has is 5000, at 250 per HEAL that would be 20 HEALs with nothing else
    so if 13 HEALs, 10 MOVEs, 27 TOUGHs = 3250 + 500 + 270 = 4020
    that creep needs to be able to move to a room to attack, then wait on the edge, and heal itself every tick

    role = bait

    move to room to attack
    move as far away from tower as possible while staying in room
        for now set a flag to move to?
    sit and heal yourself
    if you get below say 400 total health, move back to other room and heal up more
    if no room to attack move to SPAWN so you get healed (maybe make spawns heal these creeps at all HP)

once towers are down, send in a WARRIOR

need to fix code to deal with walls
    if no path to a target but hostile targets in room, then get PathByRange(?), walk that till you get to
    a wall, then break it down
    in the short term let me set a flag and then go attack that wall if no creeps/buildings reachable
    
need to build combat groups
    first use case - harvesting power
        needs one big creep with mostly ATTACK/MOVE
            open question does it need TOUGH
        then two creeps that heal the big one, mostly HEAL/MOVE
    behavior of a group
        set common target for moving to 
            healers follow tank, tank just goes there
            need way for tank to wait if healers fall behind
        set common target for attacking
            tank attackes it, healers follow tank and heal it as needed
        stage 
            wait for entire group to be spawned and reach a specified box
    how do you create a group
        say "I want a group with a medic and an attacker"
        so createSquad(medic:1,attacker:1)
            that will spawn the two creeps, and assign them as the right parts of the squad, e.g. squad.medic 
    what does group look like
        could be arbitrary number of creeps
        >1 tho, only 2 3 4 5 probably
        start with 2
        what if we pass an array, like creep spawning, [attack attack medic]
        then you can process that array with forEach
            give it an id
            if no creep with id, spawn it
            if creep with id, process it
            if not all creeps ready yet, wait
            maybe a state model where you know when they're all spawned
            like a lifecycle - init, spawn, spawnDone, form, meet, move 
        always going to have a target room and a mission
        like mission is [attack,defend]
        target is [powerSpawn, room, specific structure]
        how do you maintain state across ticks
            each squad has an ID, store the squad in memory?
                so memory looks like
                    { id {
                        mission:
                        target:
                        spawnRoom:
                        }
                    }
            so you create the squad one tick, based off of what? a queue?
    once you have the squad defined (in memory)
        spawn each of the members
        send them to stage point
        send them to target room
        have them kick ass
    spawning
        use buildQueue I guess?
        so just assume if it successfully got in the build queue, it's going to spawn?
        give it a job or some ID in memory so you can wait for it to show up, maybe like squad-squadID-memberID
    once creeps are spawned
        medic will come to attacker
        attacker waits for medic to be within 3 squares, then starts going to targetRoom, checks each tick and if medic is >3 squares away, waits
