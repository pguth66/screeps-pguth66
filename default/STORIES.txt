INVASION
    spawned a warrior, it attacked and did some damage but didn't kill the invader
    towers were set to <8 range, the creep was outside that attacking my walls
    haulers went to get the dropped resources
    haulers got hurt bad enough they had only MOVE, no CARRY - but still counted as haulers for the spawning logic
    healer went to fix the walls, somehow got stuck on the rampart with no MOVE parts
    so next warrior spawned had no path to the invader, so it went to another room!
    now I'm out of energy in spawn/extensions, and my haulers are alivebut can't haul
    eventually room shut down, as workers drained the containers of energy and new harvesters couldn't spawn
    also new haulers wouldn't spawn because it prioritizes harvesters!!!!
